## üìñ Abstract
This project aims to design and implement a **campus second-hand trading platform** that solves common problems faced by university students when buying and selling second-hand goods. Current methods (via chat groups and informal platforms) cause information overload, inefficiency, and trust issues.  
Our platform will centralize trading activities, offer structured search and categorization, and provide safer, more reliable transactions tailored for students.

## üõ†Ô∏è Problem Diagnosis
### Current Issues
1. **Information Overload** in chat groups and forums.  
2. **Fragmented Communication** across multiple platforms.  
3. **Lack of Standardized Categorization** and keyword search.  
4. **Unstructured Transaction Processes** (no status tracking, manual follow-ups).  
5. **Trust and Safety Concerns** (no verification, no reputation system).  

### Core Problems
- Efficiency deficiencies (long time-to-transaction, wasted effort).  
- Discovery limitations (no personalized recommendations, ambiguous categories).  
- Transaction reliability issues (no record, no accountability).  
- Trust and safety gaps (no verification, no dispute resolution).

## üí° Proposed Project Description
### System Features
- **User Module:** Campus email registration & login, profile management.  
- **Item Module:** Item posting with title, description, price, category, images.  
- **Transaction Module:** Trade initiation, simple order generation, automatic notifications.  
- **Search & Recommendation:** Keyword & category search, basic recommendation system.  

### Business Value
- **For Buyers:** Quickly find affordable items.  
- **For Sellers:** Easily reach buyers, regain value from unused goods.  
- **For Campus:** Encourage recycling, reduce waste, promote sustainability.  

### Example Scenario
Student Li needs a rice cooker.  
- He searches "rice cooker" on the platform.  
- The system shows relevant postings.  
- Li contacts seller Wang through the platform‚Äôs messaging feature.  
- Both confirm transaction via automatic prompts.  
‚û° Faster and more reliable than chat groups.
